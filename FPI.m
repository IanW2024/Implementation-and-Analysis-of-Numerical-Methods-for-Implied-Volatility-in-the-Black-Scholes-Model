% Parameters
S = 100;  % Current stock price
K = 95;   % Option strike price
T = 0.5;  % Time to maturity (in years)
r = 0.02; % Risk-free interest rate
P_market = 8;  % Market price of the call option

% Initial guess for sigma (implied volatility)
sigma_guess = 0.2;  % This is an arbitrary starting point

% Parameters for the iterative process
max_iterations = 100;
tolerance = 1e-6;

% Iterative adjustment (not standard fixed-point iteration!)
for i = 1:max_iterations
    price_guess = FPI_call(S, K, T, r, sigma_guess);
    error = P_market - price_guess;
    
    % Adjust sigma - Note this is an arbitrary adjustment and not based on fixed-point theory
    sigma_guess = sigma_guess + error * 0.01;  % Adjustment factor, this is quite arbitrary

    % Check if the error is within the tolerance
    if abs(error) < tolerance
        break;  % The estimate is good enough
    end
end

% Output the estimated implied volatility
fprintf('Estimated implied volatility: %.9f\n', sigma_guess);
